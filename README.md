# [Analysis on Italian football teams](https://github.com/LucianoBesada/Analysis_on_Italian_football_teams/blob/main/Investigate%20a%20dataset%20Project%20-%20Italian%20Football%20Teams%20%20.ipynb)
Deep analysis on Italian football teams using *SQL*, *Python* and Visualization libraries.

The purpose of this work is to analyse the performance from 2008/2009 to 2015/2016 season for three main Italian football teams: *F.C. Internazionale* , *A.C. Milan* , and *Juventus*.
All the data has been collected and organized from [Kaggle - European Soccer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer). 
The Dataset contains data for soccer matches, players, and teams from European Countries from 2008 to 2016.

This report will explore the results, points, and differences between these teams. With the final aim to answer these questions:
- What were the average collected points per match per each season from these teams?
- What factors influence more the result at the end of the season: to score more goals? to take fewer of them? or to have a balance between attack and defense?
- Are the supporters a good motivation to perform better or the pressure on playing at home had an opposite impact on these teams?
